# pykosinus

pykosinus is an open-source Python library for text similarity search scoring. It provides a fast and memory-efficient way to calculate cosine similarity scores, making it suitable for various text similarity applications. The library is designed to be user-friendly and encourages contributions from the community.

## Installation

To install pykosinus, make sure you have Python 3.8.17 or higher installed. Then, you can install the library using pip:

```shell
pip install pykosinus
```

## Usage
To use pykosinus in your Python project, you can follow these steps:

- Import the necessary modules and classes:
```python
from pykosinus import Content
from pykosinus.lib.scoring import CosineSimilarity
```

- Create an instance of the **CosineSimilarity** class, providing the collection name as a parameter:
```python
similarity = CosineSimilarity(collection_name)
```

- Set the contents to be searched using the **push_contents** method, passing a list of **Content** objects:
```python
contents = [
    Content(
        content="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",
        identifier="blog-1",
        section="blog_title",
    ),
    Content(
        content="Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.",
        identifier="blog-2",
        section="blog_title",
    ),
    Content(
        content="Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris.",
        identifier="blog-3",
        section="blog_title",
    ),
    # Add more contents as needed
]
similarity.push_contents(contents)
```

- Initialize the similarity search by calling the **initialize** method:
```python
similarity.initialize()
```

- Perform a similarity search by calling the **search** method, providing a keyword and an optional threshold:
```python
results = similarity.search(keyword="search keyword", threshold=0.2)
```

- The **search** method returns a list of **ScoringResult** objects, which contain the relevant information about the search results. You can access the properties of each result, such as **identifier**, **content**, **section**, **similar**, and **score**.
```python
for result in results:
    print(
        result.identifier, result.content, result.section, result.similar, result.score
    )
```
